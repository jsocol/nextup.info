# NextUp.info

NextUp was an experiment in using a
[PTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_the_Interruption)-style
countdown clock to make standups faster.

It's still available [on my site](https://jamessocol.com/nextup.info/),
and the code is freely available under an [Apache 2.0
License](./LICENSE).

But it is very old and unmaintained. It runs on an incredibly old
version of jQuery that is certainly considered insecure at this point.
Use at your own risk.
